= Values, Spaces, and Places

The result of an expression in Vine has one of three _forms_: a value, a space,
or a place.

- a _value_ represents some piece of data
- a _space_ represents somewhere that data can be put
- a _place_ is the combination of a value and a space.

We'll use the following code example to explore these concepts further.

```vi
let x = 1 + 2;
x + 1;
x = 5;
x *= 2;
```

On line 1, the expression #expr[`1 + 2`] results in the value #expr[`3`]. The variable #expr[`x`] is
then declared with an initial value of #expr[`3`].

On line 2, the expression #expr[`x`] results in its value #expr[`3`], so the expression
#expr[`x + 1`] results in the value #expr[`4`]. This expression is unused so its result is
simply discarded.

On line 3, we have an assignment statement. This expects a space on the
left-hand side, and a value on the right-hand side, and will put the value into
the space. In this particular case, the expression #expr[`x`] on the left-hand side
results in a space â€“ whatever value is put into this space will become the new
value of #expr[`x`]. Then, the assignment operator puts the value #expr[`5`] into the space.
The value of #expr[`x`] is now #expr[`5`].

On line 4, the #op[`*=`] operator expects a place on the left-hand side, and a value
on the right-hand side. Thus, #expr[`x`] results in its place, which is the combination
of the value #expr[`5`] and a space to put a new value for #expr[`x`]. The #op[`*=`] operator uses
the value to calculate #expr[`5 * 2`], and puts the value #expr[`10`] into #expr[`x`]'s space. Thus,
the value of #expr[`x`] is now #expr[`10`].

== Expression Resolution

=== Expression Positions

Every expression is located in either a value position, a space position, or a
place position. The form of the expression's position determines the form of the
result of the expression.

We saw above that the expression #expr[`x`] could result in a value, a space, or a
place; this is determined by the form of its position.

- On line 2, in #expr[`x + 1`], #expr[`x`] is in a value position, so it results in a value.
- On line 3, in #expr[`x = 5`], #expr[`x`] is in a space position, so it results in a space.
- On line 4, in #expr[`x *= 2`], #expr[`x`] is in a place position, so it results in a place.

=== Expression Forms

Independent of its position, every expression has a form - it is either a value
expression, a space expression, or a place expression. For example, variable
expressions, like #expr[`x`], are place expressions.

The form of an expression determines the form of what the expression *evaluates
to*. If this form does not match the form of the expression's position, it is
_coerced_ to become the result.

- On line 2, in #expr[`x + 1`], #expr[`x`] evaluates to a place. It is in a value position, so
  it is coerced to a value.
- On line 3, in #expr[`x = 5`], #expr[`x`] evaluates to a place. It is in a space position, so
  it is coerced to a space.
- On line 4, in #expr[`x *= 2`], #expr[`x`] evaluates to a place. It is in a place position,
  so it is not coerced.

=== Coercion

There are two rules for coercion.

- When a place is coerced to a value, the resulting value is a copy of the
  place's value; the other copy is put into the place's space.

- When a place is coerced to a space, the resulting space is the place's space;
  the place's value is discarded.

These two rules result in the behavior described in the first section.

Values and spaces cannot be coerced. It is an error to have a value expression
in a non-value position, or a space expression in a non-space position.
