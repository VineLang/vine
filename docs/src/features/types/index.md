# Types

Vine is statically typed. Every expression has a type, like `Bool` or
`List[N32]`. Type parameters are written in square brackets.

Types fall in to several categories:

- [primitive types](./primitives.md) are fundamental types defined by the
  compiler
- [standard types](./primitives.md) are commonly-used types defined by the
  standard library
- [structs](./structs.md) and [enums](./enums.md) are user-defined types
