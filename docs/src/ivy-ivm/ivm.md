# IVM Overview

IVM is a performant interaction combinator runtime. It is used to run Ivy
programs (and thus also Vine programs, since they compile to Ivy).

To run an Ivy program on the IVM, each named global net is translated into a
list of instructions for assembling the net (e.g. create a node, then link these
two ports). These instructions are used to perform
[Expand](./interaction-system.md#expand) interactions.

The IVM then boots, creating a single active pair between a global agent for the
`::main` net, and an [`IO` extrinsic value](./extrinsics.md#io-1).

The IVM then enters its main loop to perform interactions. The first interaction
will always be an Expand interaction between the `::main` agent and the `IO`
value. The IVM follows the instructions for assembling the `::main` net. This
creates more active pairs, which are continually reduced.
[Call](./interaction-system.md#call) interactions may have side effects,
allowing the net to interact with the outside world. Once all interactions are
performed, the net will be in normal form. Since the starting net had no free
ports, if no vicious circles are formed, the final net will empty.

## Parallel Evaluation

The IVM can also be run in a parallel mode. In parallel mode, after boot, the
IVM spawns the configured number of *worker* threads. The main thread then
assumes the role of the *dispatch* thread.

The worker threads are responsible for performing interactions, whilst the
dispatch thread distributes active pairs among the workers. Each worker has two
buffers of active pairs: one that it is currently reducing, and one that is
shared with the dispatch thread. This shared buffer is used to pass work from
the dispatch to the worker (if the worker is idle) or from the worker to the
dispatch (if the worker is overloaded).
