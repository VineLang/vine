  The Vine Programming Language
</h1>

Vine is an experimental new programming language based on interaction nets.

Vine is still under heavy development; there are many bugs, and many things will change.

See [`vine/examples/`](./vine/examples/) for examples of Vine.

```sh
cargo run -p vine-cli --bin vine -- run vine/examples/$NAME
```
